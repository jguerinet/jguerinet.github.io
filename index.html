            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am an avid developer mainly focused on Android mobile development. I have been
                working on the Android platform for over 6 years, constantly learning about the new
                technologies in order to keep my projects modern and up to date. Recently I have
                switched to doing all of my Android development in Kotlin. I have also developed iOS
                apps and have dabbled in web development, specifically TypeScript and Node.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently a freelance Android developer looking for my next big project. In the
                meantime I have been working on personal projects and deepening my knowledge on all
                the technologies mentioned above.
            </p>
            <p>I have used the following languages and platforms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Java (8 years)</li>
                <li>Git (8 years)</li>
                <li>Android (6 years)</li>
                <li>Kotlin (2 years)</li>
                <li>Swift (2 years)</li>
                <li>iOS</li>
                <li>Objective-C</li>
                <li>TypeScript</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
            </ul>

                            Suitcase is a set of Android utility classes and functions that I use in
                            all of my projects. It was built for Kotlin, and covers multiple aspects
                            of Android development such as coroutines, dialos, lifecycle components,
                            and more.

                            Morf is a form generation library. Built for Kotlin, it allows you to
                            create highly customizable programmatically generated forms.

                            Weave takes an online CSV file and parses its content to produce String
                            files for Android, iOS, and the web. This allows you to use the same
                            Strings for the same app across multiple platforms.

                            initially the QA tester for the first iOS version of the app, and was
                            then tasked with bringing it to Android. We released the Android version
                            in March 2014. Up until January 2019, I was the main Android developer,
                            a secondary iOS developer, and the lead of the development team for the
                            app.

                            took on the role of project manager and lead Android developer. We
                            released MyMartlet for Android on September 2014 and I am still actively
                            maintaining the app.

                        <p>
                            While working at Ottawa mHealth, we developed The Ottawa Rules, an app
                            containing clinical decision guidelines for physicians. I developed the
                            Android version and part of the iOS version.

                            Another project at Ottawa mHealth was SafeLiving, an app designed to
                            help transplant patients keep track of vital health aspects of their
                            life such as vaccinations, medication, and allergies. I developed the
                            Android version and most of the iOS version.

                            I developed the Android version of the app used during the bi-annual

                            developer to port over the iOS version of the app to Android, and give
                            it a new modern look.
